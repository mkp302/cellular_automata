\section{Introduction}
The goal of this research is to evaluate the use of cellular automaton in modelling the forest fires that occurred in Newfoundland during the Summer of 2025.

Cellular Automaton use simple rules to model complex processes. Useful for simulations where each successive state only depends on the state of its immediate neighbours. There are different types Von Neuman.

One application of Cellualar Automaton is to model the spread of forest fires.
